Inspired from the beginning scene of Star Wars Episode 6, a door will open and close for incoming deliveries and packages. The only way to open and close the door is through the beacon. This prevents any intruders trying to trick the door into opening. When a confirmed package arrives to their door, the owner will tell Alexa to open the door. The person delivering the package would simply have to slide their package through the door. To close the door, the owner will just have to tell Alexa to close it.
